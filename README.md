# aave-margin
Lever short or long using Aave.

## Idea
Currently, one can use Aave to deposit an asset and borrow funds. Users have been using these capabilities to create long and short positions. For example, if you want to go 2x long $ETH, you can buy $ETH, deposit $ETH in Aave, borrow $USDC on Aave, swap $USDC for $ETH, and repeat until you have 2x the $ETH you started with.

This dapp will lever long for you.
